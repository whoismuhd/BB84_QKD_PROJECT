Step 1 Explanation

In this step, I created the quantum basis and implemented the initial quantum operations.
Key: Mohammed's random sequence of bits (0 or 1) representing the bits he wants to send.
Basis: The quantum basis (0 = standard, 1 = Hadamard) for encoding the qubits.

Step 2 Explanation
In this step, I simulated Mohammeds encoding and sending qubits.
Mohammed will encode the bits into qubits using the chosen basis and "send" them to Ada
The code uses Qiskit to create a single-qubit quantum circuit for each bit:
Standard Basis (0): Encodes the qubit as either |0⟩ or |1⟩.
Hadamard Basis (1): Encodes the qubit as either |+⟩ or |−⟩.

Step 3
In this step, Ada measures teh recieved qubits
In this step, Ada randomly chooses a measurement basis and tries to decode the qubits Mohammed sent.
Measurement Basis: Ada randomly selects a basis (standard or Hadamard) for each qubit.
Simulated Measurement: Since we are not running on a real quantum computer, the measurement probabilities are approximated for now.

Step 4
In this step, I reconciled Mohammed's and Ada's Keys
In this step, Mohammed and Ada compare their measurement bases to identify the bits they both measured in the same basis.
Basis Comparison: Mohammed and Ada compare their bases. If they match, the corresponding bit is retained; otherwise, it’s discarded.
Shared Key: The result is the key they both agree upon.

Step 5
In this step I verified the security of the shared key
In this step, Mohammed and Ada will check for eavesdropping by comparing a subset of their shared key.
Subset Selection: Mohammed and Ada randomly select a subset of the shared key bits to compare.
Verification:
If the subset matches, no eavesdropping is detected.
If it doesn't match, eavesdropping may have occurred.

Step 6
I simulated eavesdropping, by introducing Eve's Random Measurement.
I Modified the qubits before Ada receives them by having Eve measure each qubit with a random basis.
Eve’s Random Basis: Eve chooses a random basis (standard or Hadamard) to measure each qubit.
Effect of Eavesdropping: When Eve uses a basis different from Mohammed’s encoding or Ada’s decoding, it introduces errors.

Step 7
In thsi step I added noise by Simulating a noisy quantum channel to differentiate between noise and eavesdropping errors.
Noise in a quantum channel introduces random errors in qubits, just like eavesdropping. This will allow us to compare noise-induced errors to eavesdropping-induced errors.
Noise Probability: The probability of flipping a qubit’s state.
Effect of Noise: Adds random errors to the transmitted qubits, similar to the effect of eavesdropping.

Step 8 
In this step, I logged Eve’s basis choices, measurements, and their impact on the qubits. This will help us analyze how Eve's actions introduce errors into the communication.
Logging Eve’s Actions:
Records which basis Eve chose (Standard or Hadamard).
Logs the measurement result and how Eve re-prepared the qubit.
Impact Analysis: Logs help in understanding the errors Eve introduces.
